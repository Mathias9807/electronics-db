Database that stores electronic components. Some kind of lookup web interface. 

A component has some information attached:
	- ID
	- Name
	- Component type(?)
	- Number of components
	- An image(?)

Then subentities for every component type, eg.

Transistor(ComponentName, Type(PNP,NPN), …)

Component(Name, Type, Amount)

Web interface should let you search for compomnents, insert new components and
create new component types. 

Search
	Should be able to search after component name and filter by component
	type. Also filter after component specific properties. 

Insert new component
	A component has to have a type and will have component specific info
	för every component type.

Create new component type
	Should be able to add a component type and edit existing types

Interface should work well in both a computer and on a phone
